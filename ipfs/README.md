# IPFS cluster

```
ipfs-cluster-service init --consensus <crdt/raft>
```

- service.json contains a default peer configuration. Usually, **all peers in a Cluster should have exactly the same configuration.**
- identity.json contains the peer private key and ID. These are unique to each Cluster peer.
- peerstore is an empty file used to store the peer addresses of other peers so that this peer knows where to contact them.

The new service.json file generated by ipfs-cluster-service init will have a randomly generated secret value in the cluster section. For a Cluster to work, **this value should be the same in all cluster peers**

**If present, the CLUSTER_SECRET environment value is used when running ipfs-cluster-service init to set the cluster secret value.**
